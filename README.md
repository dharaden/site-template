# Website Template
An updated website that can be created in R using Quarto and GitHub Pages

Here is a brief walkthrough of things to update in order to have your website appear. 

There should be 3 different branches
1. main (default)
2. gh-pages
3. github-action

## Step 1: Allow GitHub Action to render website
- Navigate to the current repo and select settings
- Settings > Actions > General
- Scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
-  Make sure "Read and write permissions" is selected (this gives the github-actions[bot] permission to push)
